Application to create and save meters 

The objectives were:
 - to be able to create a meter with a specific name and save it -> functional.
 - be able to modify the counters already registered -> in development.
 - to have a vibration when adding to the meter -> functional on IOS (not tested on Android).
 - to visualize the registered meters -> functional.

The problems encountered
 - localStorage clear management on iOS -> not functional for now.
 - theming possibilities -> need to found more on how its works with ionic.

Improvements planned :
 - add an export function to export all meters or only selected one
 - possibilities to take picture and add them as meter thumbnail
